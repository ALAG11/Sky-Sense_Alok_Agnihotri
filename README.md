# The GitHub use cases I used and helped me in my submission are:-

1. Version Control: I used the version control use case of GitHub. This use case helped me in track changes to the codebase over time and its features like commits, branches, and merges, enabled me to manage and organize my code modifications effectively.
2. Code Hosting: The code hosting use case of GitHub helped me to host my code on its repositories on the web making it easily accessible for anyone outside other than me. 
3. Documentation: I also used the Documentation use case of GitHub as it provide developers with a space for project documentation, such as README files or documentation folders. Developers can use these features to document the project's setup instructions, usage guidelines, API references, and other relevant information.
4. GitHub Copilot: GitHub Copilot is one of the most amazing use case of GitHub as it helped me a lot in my devleopment work of this application. All the general and boilerplate code and codes of some fnctions also got automatically generated and completed by the GitHub copilot saving my time and also enhancing my productivity.

# To run this application in your system follow these steps:-
1. First clone the full GitHub repository in your system using the "git clone" command from your terminal.
2. Then navigate to the directory where you have cloned the repository using "cd" command from the terminal.
3.  In that cloned repository directory first run the "requirements.txt" file using the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" on your terminal to download the application dependencies so that the application can run smoothly without any errors.
4. Then open the python file named "sky_sense_alok_agnihotri.py" in any of your favourite IDE or text editor and edit the lines "API KEY" and "BASE URL" with your own API key and base url that you can get from the open weather map website.
4. Then run the file named "sky_sense_alok_agnihotri.py" using the command "python sky_sense_alok_agnihotri.py" in the terminal.
5. Your application is started, now follow the instructions on the terminal screen to get your desired output through the application.
