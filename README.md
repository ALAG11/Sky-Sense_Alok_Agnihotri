# The GitHub use cases I used and helped me in my submission are:-

1. Version Control: I used the version control use case of GitHub. This use case helped me in track changes to the codebase over time and its features like commits, branches, and merges, enabled me to manage and organize my code modifications effectively.
2. Code Hosting: The code hosting use case of GitHub helped me to host my code on its repositories on the web making it easily accessible for anyone outside other than me. 
3. Documentation: I also used the Documentation use case of GitHub as it provide developers with a space for project documentation, such as README files or documentation folders. Developers can use these features to document the project's setup instructions, usage guidelines, API references, and other relevant information.
4. GitHub Copilot: GitHub Copilot is one of the most amazing use case of GitHub as it helped me a lot in my devleopment work of this application. All the general and boilerplate code and codes of some fnctions also got automatically generated and completed by the GitHub copilot saving my time and also enhancing my productivity.
